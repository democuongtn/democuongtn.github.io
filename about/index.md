![about_me](https://remyniscent.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_7151.jpg)


I was born in Hanoi but currently living in Melbourne for my higher education purpose. I major in Marketing and always try to apply what I have learned in running a business.

Apart from the ambition of being a future entrepreneur, I find myself a wanderlust, a food lover and a beauty addict. These three things are also the inspirations that make me want to create this blog.

I hope to share with everyone the beautiful places that I have travelled to, the mouthwatering food that I have chances to taste and some beauty products that I am currently using which I find effective.

Thank you for visiting! xoxo
