These are my favorite nail colours of the autumn, all of which are from Sally Hansen❤. They glide on my nails really smoothly. You can achieve the actual colour on the bottle within two coats. Moreover, they have big brushes so they can cover most part of your nails so you don’t have to give too many strokes

These nail colours are so neutral that I can wear them daily and on any occasion, which is another advantage!

On my hand 372 – Greige

It is absolutely hard to find a nail colour that is suitable to my skin tone and I’m so glad that I’ve finally found one which does not either darken my skin or accentuate the green-ish yellow undertone. Whoever has a similar skin tone like mine, please give this a try!

This top coat from Essie is amazing! It’s thick, it’s super shiny and helps the polishes dry really quickly, within literally 1 minute~

What are your favorite nail colours? Please comment down below!
