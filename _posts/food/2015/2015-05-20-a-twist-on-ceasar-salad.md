Caesar Salad is my most favorite one. Today, I will share with you my version of this dish which is simple, healthy, yet filling enough to have it as the main meal for the dinner.

I toss in a big bowl together 250g leafy mix with a handful of cherry tomatoes, 2 hard boiled eggs, 2 crispy fried lean bacon rashers and 2 toasted sandwich slices. Everything should be cut into smaller pieces. Add in some creamy sauce and you are good to go! EnjoyðŸ˜€

My little trick to cut the hard boiled egg: use 20cm of white thread (hold it the same way as using dental floss lol) to cut the egg instead of the knife to avoid the yolk separating from the white!
