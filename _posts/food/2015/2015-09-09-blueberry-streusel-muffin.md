This is my favorite muffin recipe ever! These muffins are absolutely moist with the help of yoghurt and blueberries, a bit crunchy from the walnuts which I love and they smell heavenly of cinnamon and butter.

Not to mention, it is so easy to make, just mix every ingredient together, put the mixture into the muffin liners and into the oven~

Something that stays right and is not wrapped in a para.
